    description: >
      This is a very long description that is designed to exceed the default
      str2000 character limit in Stata. It contains detailed methodology notes,
      data collection procedures, and extensive documentation about how the
      indicator is calculated and what it measures. The description continues
      with more information about the data sources used, the geographic coverage
      of the indicator, and the time period for which data is available. It also
      includes notes about data quality, limitations, and comparability across
      countries and over time. Furthermore, it provides guidance on how to
      interpret the indicator values and what policy implications can be drawn
      from the data. Additional technical notes describe the statistical methods
      used in estimation, including model specifications, assumptions, and
      sensitivity analyses. The documentation also covers the revision policy
      and how previously published estimates may be updated as new data becomes
      available. Cross-references to related indicators and complementary data
      sources are provided for users who need a more comprehensive picture.
      Quality assurance procedures include validation checks against external
      benchmarks, peer review of methodology, and regular audits of the data
      processing pipeline. The indicator is aligned with international standards
      and classifications, including those maintained by the United Nations
      Statistical Commission and relevant specialized agencies. Historical data
      may be subject to retroactive revisions when improved source data or
      methods become available, and users should always refer to the most recent
      release for the authoritative estimates. End of description.
