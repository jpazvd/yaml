{marker v201}{...}
{title:Version 2.0.1 (06Aug2026)}

{pstd}
{bf:scalars() quote safety} {hline 2} {cmd:yaml write, scalars()} now writes
string scalars whose values contain double quotes. Previously the scalar
line used plain quotes, so such a value terminated the write with r(198)
and left a truncated file on disk.

{marker v200}{...}
{title:Version 2.0.0 (26Jul2026)}

{pstd}
{bf:Sequences of mappings} {hline 2} The canonical parser now supports list
items that are themselves mappings ({cmd:- key: value} with further keys
nested under the item), in either indentation style {hline 2} the {cmd:-}
written flush with the parent key (the default emitted by many YAML writers)
or indented beneath it {hline 2} as used by harmonization maps and CI
configuration. Each item is stored as a structural row {it:list}_N (type
{cmd:list_map}) with its keys as children; {cmd:yaml write} regenerates the
dash form; nested mappings under items are supported. The {cmd:bulk} and
{cmd:fastread} parsers reject such items with an explicit error.
{p_end}

{pstd}
{bf:Colon paths} {hline 2} {cmd:yaml get} and {cmd:yaml list} accept
multi-level colon paths: {cmd:a:b:c} addresses the flattened key {cmd:a_b_c};
the parent/key split is made at the last colon.
{p_end}

{pstd}
{bf:One quoting rule} {hline 2} In all parse modes, surrounding quotes are
stripped only when the first and last characters are the same quote
character; quoted values are always typed string; escape sequences are kept
literal.
{p_end}

{pstd}
{bf:Write fidelity} {hline 2} {cmd:yaml write} emits boolean rows as
{cmd:true}/{cmd:false} and null rows as an empty value, so a read-write
cycle preserves YAML literals.
{p_end}

{pstd}
{bf:Reproducible output} {hline 2} {cmd:yaml write} no longer stamps a
wall-clock {cmd:# Date:} line in the header by default, so a written file is
byte-for-byte reproducible across runs. The new {opt timestamp} option
restores the date line, and {opt noheader} omits the header comment entirely.
{p_end}

{pstd}
{bf:Fixes} {hline 2} {cmd:yaml describe} now shows each row by its leaf name, so
the tree mirrors the source file: a key under {cmd:database:} prints as
{cmd:host:} rather than {cmd:database_host:}. The indentation already carries
the path, so repeating the flattened prefix at every level was redundant.
{cmd:yaml write, scalars()} now writes the named scalars:
the existence guard was a bare {cmd:scalar} {it:name}, which is not a validity
test and fails even when the scalar is defined, so every scalar was skipped and
only the header was written. String scalars are emitted as well.
The {opt stata} option of {cmd:yaml list} now returns a
usable compound-quoted list: the final trim wrapped the quoted list in plain
double quotes, collapsing {cmd:r(keys)}/{cmd:r(values)} to a single backtick, so
a {cmd:foreach} over the result iterated once on an invalid name.
{cmd:yaml list, children} again returns bare child
names as documented (regression in the modular refactor); {cmd:noheader} is
recognized again and now suppresses all output; the parent filter no longer
ignores its argument; {cmd:yaml list} returns {cmd:r(found)}; scalar-leaf
{cmd:yaml get} returns {cmd:r(value)}; fast-read {cmd:yaml read} returns
{cmd:r(n_keys)}; a whole-node {cmd:yaml get} on a block sequence of scalars
returns the space-joined items in {cmd:r(value)} instead of erroring.
{p_end}


{marker v192}{...}
{title:Version 1.9.2 (22Feb2026) {hline 2} Parser parity fixes}

{pstd}
{bf:List-item quote stripping} {hline 2} The canonical parser now strips surrounding
quotes from YAML list item values, matching the Mata bulk parser behavior.
Previously, values like {cmd:"Climate Change"} retained their quotes in canonical
mode but not in bulk mode.
{p_end}

{pstd}
{bf:Sibling parent_stack fix} {hline 2} Fixed parent_stack contamination where
adjacent parent keys at the same indent level (e.g., {cmd:topic_ids:} followed by
{cmd:topic_names:}) could produce incorrect field names. Both canonical and Mata
bulk parsers now correctly restore the parent context for sibling keys.
{p_end}


{marker v190}{...}
{title:Version 1.9.0 (20Feb2026) {hline 2} Indicators preset}

{pstd}
{bf:Indicators Preset} {hline 2} One-step shortcut for parsing wbopendata and
unicefdata indicator metadata YAML files. Automatically enables {cmd:bulk}
and {cmd:collapse} with standard field selection.

{phang2}{cmd:. yaml read using indicators.yaml, indicators replace}{p_end}


{marker v180}{...}
{title:Version 1.8.0 (20Feb2026) {hline 2} Collapse filter options}

{pstd}
{bf:Collapse Filters} {hline 2} Added {cmd:colfields()} to filter collapsed
output to specific field names (semicolon-separated), and {cmd:maxlevel()}
to limit collapsed columns by nesting depth. Designed for large indicator
metadata catalogs.
{p_end}

{pstd}
Added FEAT-09 test for collapse filter options.
{p_end}


{marker v170}{...}
{title:Version 1.7.0 (20Feb2026) {hline 2} Mata bulk-load and collapse}

{pstd}
{bf:Bulk Parser} {hline 2} Added {cmd:bulk} option for high-performance
Mata-based YAML parsing. Combined with {cmd:collapse}, produces wide-format
output with one row per top-level key. Added {cmd:strl} option for values
exceeding 2045 characters.
{p_end}

{pstd}
Added FEAT-05 and FEAT-06 tests for bulk and collapse features.
{p_end}


{marker v160}{...}
{title:Version 1.6.0 (18Feb2026)}

{pstd}
Mata {cmd:st_sstore()} for embedded quote safety in canonical parser.
Block scalar support ({cmd:|}, {cmd:>}) in canonical parser.
Continuation lines for multi-line scalars.
